# M152b Fall 2018 Codebase


## Lab 0 - Introduction
Brief introduction lab to get used to verilog and Xilinx ISE again.

## Lab 1 - ALU + Register File
Implement a 1 bit and 16 bit ALU using only structural verilog, and then implement a register file with behavioral verilog.

## Lab 2 - Traffic Light Simulation
Implement a FSM to simulate a traffic light junction with a walk light button for pedestrians and traffic sensor. 

### Lab 3 - Microblaze
Create a soft processor on the FPGA to be able to write C code. Part 1 = create a simple multiplication program that lights up an led if the value > 100. 
Part 2 = create a rock-paper-scissors game that takes one input from the stdin and another input from a Digilent keypad attached to the FPGA.
